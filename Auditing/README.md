# Introduction

Understanding Audit Policy configuration is imperative for your Domain Controllers.  This includes Azure Advanced Threat Protection (AATP) and Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA).  Use this tool to ensure your DCs have the proper settings to maximize your detection capability.

## Why is this important?

For more information, please refer to this [blog](https://ciberesponce.com/2017/08/18/ata-auditing-auditpol-advanced-audit-settings-enforcement-lightweight-gateway-service-discovery/).

_**New features in recent versions:**_

- Ability to support Azure ATP (AATP); this is the default value now
- Ability to support ATA v1.9
- Ability to target a specific domain

## Getting Started

For default values (assess against Azure ATP (AATP), throttling with 10 concurrent processes):

```PowerShell
    .\Measure-AatpDeployment.ps1
```

To configure the throttling of the processes (i.e. not being run on a DC or from a well resourced machine), use the "RunJobsThrottle" parameter.  In this example, we set this paramter to 100:

```PowerShell
    .\Measure-Aatpeployment.ps1 -RunJobsThrottle 100
```

To assess against ATA's v1.9, use the "AtaVersion" parameter, which takes a *string* value:

```PowerShell
    .\Measure-AatpDeployment.ps1 -AtaVersion "1.9"
```

This tool can assess ATA v1.9, 1.8 and 1.7.

To make the assessment against just one domain/child-domain, use the "Fqdn" parameter, as a *string* value:

```PowerShell
    .\Measure-AatpDeployment.ps1 -Fqdn "child.contoso.com"
```
